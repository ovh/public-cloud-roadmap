# OVHcloud Public Cloud Roadmap

## How to use
- You can consult the board of your choice to **find out the current features planned** in the backlog :
[Compute, storage & Network ](https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/3 "Compute, Storage and Network"), [ Orchestration and Containers ](https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/1 "Orchestration and Containers"), 
[Databases and Data Analytics](https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/2 "Databases and Data Analytics board"), [AI and Machine learning](https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/4 "AI and Machine learning board")

[Looking for our VMware, Nutanix or Anthos Hosted Private Cloud roadmap ?](https://github.com/ovh/hosted-private-cloud-roadmap "OVHcloud VMware, Nutanix and Anthos Hosted Private Cloud")
- You can **watch a given feature** to get email notifications when it is modified or moves forward
- You can **comment or vote** for listed features to influence our specifications and prioritization
- You can **suggest a new issue** to the backlog 

## Workflow
- New issues will be considered typically within a week and may enter one of the board's **Backlog** if they align with our product strategy.
- We regularly commit to new items on the backlog. "**Committed/Being developped**" column means that the feature has been sized and is planned for the **next 3 to 12 months**
- When these elements approach production, they are moved to "**Coming soon**". At that stage, specification are final, and the feature will hit GA usually in less than **2 months**
- We will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Changelog**" column for follow-up.

## Proposing a new feature
- Consider only new features (aka functional enhancements, new localizations, UX improvments). Specific bug reports or support requests should be opened through  [the OVHcloud help center](https://help.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/ "the OVHcloud help center")
- If you believe you've found a security issue in our service, please enter our [bug bounty programm ](https://yeswehack.com/programs/ovh#rules "bug bounty programm ")
- Please consult [Existing issues](https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/issues "Existing issues") and [product documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/ "product documentation") to avoid duplicates
- Please describe the feature in the shortest possible way, ideally as an agile user story
- We are interested in your use case associated and the current workaround you have found if they exist. Please comment your own issue with those details if possible.
