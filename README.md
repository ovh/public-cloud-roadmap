## Notes/Disclaimer
- New issues will be considered typically within a week and may be marked as **Aknowledged** if they align with our product strategy.
- We regularly commit to new items on the backlog. "**Prioritized**" column means that the feature has been sized and is planned for the **next 3 to 12 months**
- When these elements approach production, they are moved to "**Planned**". At that stage, specification are final, and the feature will be release usually in less than **3 months**
- We will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Done**" column for follow-up. Note that most feature may also be considered "**Partially released**" if they are accessible under beta terms and/or miss UI or Terraform integration for example.
- Currently, [VMware or Nutanix Hosted Private Cloud products](https://github.com/ovh/private-cloud-provider/projects?type=classic) and [Baremetal Dedicated Servers, OS and distributions, Storage and Network](https://github.com/ovh/infrastructure-roadmap/projects?type=classic) are deplayed is their own project views.
- This public roadmap is purely indicative, and we may surprise you with additionnal strategic feature that we choose to keep confidential for some reasons.
- We may delete any inappropriate content at any time.
